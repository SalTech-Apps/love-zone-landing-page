              At <span class="font-medium text-primary">AgapeMate</span>, we are
              deeply committed to creating a safe and secure environment for all
              our users. As a Christian-based platform, we uphold the highest
              standards of integrity, love, and care, especially when it comes
              to protecting children. We have implemented robust measures to
              ensure that our app is not accessible to individuals under the age
              of 18.

              Our app is designed exclusively for individuals who are 18 years
              of age or older. During the registration process, we require users
              to confirm their age. Any account found to be created by someone
              under the age of 18 will be immediately terminated. We also use
              advanced age verification tools to ensure compliance.
